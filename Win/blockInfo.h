// should each block type be given a separate material?
// In OBJ we have two ways to group: there are groups, each group defining an object. We allow
// two kinds of grouping:
// * One group for each object type. Example: all acacia logs are an object type, so can be modified as a whole.
// * One group for each block, with each block fully formed with all its side. Example: each acacia block is an object.
// There are materials, and we share in different ways:
// * One material for all objects. This is a find choice for 3D printing, where it doesn't matter.
// * One material for each object type. So water might be transparent, lava not.

// This logic is confusing, so here are some examples:
// No OBJ export boxes checked (ignore the G3D box for all of these): no group output, single material.
// Check "Export separate types": all polygons are grouped by type (Grass_Block, Sand, Dirt), single material.
// Check "Export separate types" and "Separate materials/blocks" (the default): polygons are grouped by type, each type has a material.
// Check "Export individual blocks": same as above, polygon are grouped by type, each type has a material. However, geometrically, every block has all its faces output.
// Check "Export individual blocks" and "Separate materials/blocks": each Minecraft block is in its own group, each type has a material, blocks each use the relevant material.

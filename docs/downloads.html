        <b>Super-fast quickstart for 3D printing and rendering export:</b>
        <p><b>1) </b> Unzip mineways.zip, the whole thing, to some directory. On Windows you can actually run mineways.exe from the zip file.</p>
        <p><b>2) </b> Double-click the Mineways.exe program to run (try the Mineways32.exe if that fails). If things don't start up correctly, see <a href="#platform">this guide</a>.
		<p><b>3) </b> Use "File | Open World" to select a world. </p> 
        <p><b>4) </b> Use the left mouse button to drag the map around, use the mousewheel to zoom. "F3" takes you to the player's location.</p>
        <p><b>5) </b> Drag with the right mouse button to select an area on the map and to adjust this rectangle. </p>
        <p><b>6) </b> Optionally click with the middle mouse button or set the "Lower depth" slider to select a depth. </p>
        <p><b>7) </b> Export the model for 3D printing by "File | Export for 3D Printing" - just hit "OK" on the Options dialog. For rendering, use "File | Export for Rendering"</p> 
        <p><b>8) </b> Optional: if you want to see the result, view the .OBJ or .WRL with <a href="mineways.html#g3d">G3D, MeshLab</a>, or other 3D model viewer (avoid <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6">3D Builder</a> if you use colors; it's fine for STLs).</p>

    </P>
    <P>
      <B>3D Printing:</B> To preview your exported model to see if it's what you want, open the .wrl/.obj/.stl file with <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a> or other model viewer. If you want to 3D print your model and don't have a 3D printer (or want a multicolored model), <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/register">create a free Shapeways account</a> and <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/upload/">upload</a> the <i><b>.zip</b></i> file. Once the model is processed by Shapeways (a few minutes), you can order it - make sure to select "colored sandstone" for the material.
	  <P>
	  As an example, <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/mineways">here's</a> my non-profit store. Note that no part of this process will cost you anything, unless you actually order something. <a href="http://sculpteo.com">Sculpteo</a> is another 3D print service worth considering (see <a href="http://www.sculpteo.com/en/gallery/public/eerich666/">my sample store</a>). It's generally more expensive but often delivers more rapidly (even shipping from France!). There are other 3D print services such as <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/">3D Hubs</a>; see a <a href="mineways.html#print_services">list here</a>.
    </P>
    <P>
      <B>Rendering:</B> see <a href="mineways.html#rendering">this section</a> for how to import your model into various rendering and animation systems.
    </P>
    <P>
      What to try next: work through the <a href="mineways.html#map">documentation page</a> to learn more about other export options. The information is pretty much in order of importance. In particular, for 3D printing, check out the <a href="mineways.html#lesser">"Export lesser blocks"</a> option, which lets you get more detail. This feature is not on by default because it has some risks, so <a href="mineways.html#lesser">read about them there</a>. 
    </P>
	<h1 id="platform">Platform-Specific Problems and Fixes</h1>
	<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
		If you get "Windows protected your PC" when running Mineways, click on "More info" and then "Run anyway". <a href="http://erichaines.com">I'm trustworthy</a>.
	    <P>
		If Mineways gives you an error on startup on a Windows PC, try Mineways32. Also, version 5.x may not work for you for some reason (and please let me know why, if you figure it out): try <a href="http://realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/minewaysV417.zip">version 4.17</a> if all else fails.
		<P>
		If you get an error about MSVCR120.DLL being missing, these DLLs are included with the latest Mineways distribution. Make sure to unzip the download to a directory and run from there. That said, if you still can't run, the msvcr120.dll may cause problems. Delete it and install the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784">Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package</a> for your system. Select vcredist_x64.exe for a 64-bit system, vcredist_x86.exe if your system is 32 bits. To find out if your computer is running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows, follow <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001121.htm">the instructions here</a>, which come down to "hold down the Windows key and then click the Pause|Break key, then look for System type". Mineways32.exe should run on any PC, but export size is somewhat limited (this usually doesn't matter for 3D printing); Mineways.exe is 64-bit and will run on only 64-bit systems.
		<P>
		The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/minecraft-windows-10-edition-beta/9nblggh2jhxj">Windows 10 Edition Beta of Minecraft</a> is essentially the Pocket Edition, which Mineways does not currently understand. You need to use the normal <a href="https://minecraft.net/">PC or Mac version of Minecraft</a> to use Mineways.
		<P>
		If Mineways is blocked by Norton Antivirus, e.g., you get an error that Windows is not being able to "access the specified device, path or file": First, make sure you are downloading Mineways from this site, i.e., the links above. If the download is being autodeleted, <a href="http://community.norton.com/comment/3833313#comment-3833313">here's how to turn Norton off temporarily</a>. Otherwise, just run Mineways and ignore the warnings. <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7cd622325879c6b9218aad6ee9f59ae24271abf610e8a8229c31daef4eebaa7f/analysis/">No other antivirus software</a> reports Mineways as having a virus, so I believe it's a flaw in Norton. I won't be insulted if you are cautious and don't follow my advice, but Mineways is <a href="https://github.com/erich666/Mineways">open source</a>, and <a href="http://erichaines.com">I have a reputation as a good person</a>, so these things count against there being a virus. You can also try running <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/mineways.html#versions">older versions of Mineways</a>, this has been known to work.
    <h2 id="mac">Mac users:</h2>
    <p>Download <a href="http://realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/MinewaysMac.zip">Mineways for Mac</a>.
    <p>
	  Once installed, run Mineways - it'll take awhile to start the first time and you'll get a notice about <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>, so be patient. To load your world, use "File | Open World". If none of your worlds are listed, you'll get a warning and will need to use "File | Open..." and navigate to /users/<I>&lt;your name&gt;</I>/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/<I>&lt;your world's name&gt;</I> and select the level.dat file there.
	 <P>
	  If Mineways gives you an error on startup on the Mac, version 5.x may not work for you (and please let me know why, if you figure it out): try <a href="http://realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/MinewaysMac416.zip">version 4.16</a> if all else fails.
	<P>
	  By default, Mineways now uses its own tile textures that are stored in the program itself. Other "terrainExt.png" can be used - a number of these come with the program. Use "File | Set Terrain File" and select the terrainExt.png in /users/<I>&lt;your name&gt;</I>/Downloads/MinewaysMac or wherever you put Mineways. You might need to search for these files, just use <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/how-find-lost-mac-os-x-files-3613260/">Spotlight</a> and search on "terrainExt.png". <a href="mineways.html#terrain_png">The other terrainExt*.png files</a> will be found in this directory.
	<P>
	  When you save, go to the directory /Users/&lt;your name&gt;/Documents to save.
	  The Mac version is only 32 bits, so cannot export very large areas that the PC version can. This normally doesn't matter for 3D printing, since you want to keep the models small. If you <i>do</i> find you're out of memory, try the "Give more export memory!" option under Help, which clears out the map cache before trying to export the area you've selected.
	 <P>
	  Otherwise the Mac version is the same as the PC version, and Mac users can similarly use <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a> or <a href="http://www.glc-player.net/">GLC Player</a> for viewing exported 3D models. See <a href="mineways.html">the main documentation page</a> for (way) more help.
    </p>
	<h3>Troubleshooting for the Mac</h3>
	  If you get the warning "'Mineways' can't be opened because the identity of the developer cannot be confirmed." take steps similar to those <a href="https://support.techsmith.com/hc/en-us/articles/203727998-TechSmith-Relay-Can-t-be-opened-because-the-identity-of-the-developer-cannot-be-confirmed-">explained here</a>. The short version: right-click and select "Open," then verify that you want to run the program. Yes, <a href="http://erichaines.com">I'm trustworthy</a>.
	<P>
	  If you get the message "Couldn't find your Minecraft world saves directory..." you'll need to guide Mineways to wherever your world files are saved on your computer. Follow <a href="http://www.macinfo.us/how-to-find-minecraft-worlds-on-your-mac.php">these instructions</a>. If you are using a Mac with a language that is not English, Mineways may still have problems with the path to your files. One solution is to copy your world files to a USB flash drive - this avoids the path problems. Another solution <i>may</i> be to temporarily change the language to English.
	<P>
      If you can't see the Application Support/minecraft folder, see <a href="http://www.macinfo.us/how-to-find-minecraft-worlds-on-your-mac.php">this page</a> for how to use the terminal utility to make it visible. Short version: search for "terminal" in spotlight, copy and paste this line into the terminal and hit Enter:
	  <PRE>
	  defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
	  </PRE>
	</p>
	<P>
	  Then type or paste this line:
	  <PRE>
	  killall Finder
	  </PRE>
	</p>
	<P>
	  to restart the finder. You can find your saves folder by opening Finder -> Go -> Go To Folder -> type ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves. For future reference, it's best to make an alias for this folder and copy it to your desktop.
	</p>
	<P>
      Selection is done with right-click; if you are using a trackpad or your mouse cannot right-click, hold down the Control key and left-click, or see <a href="http://www.macinstruct.com/node/66">this page</a> for more options.
    </p>
	<P>
      We use <a href="http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/">WineBottler</a> to make mineways32.exe into a Mac app - it's pretty easy! Start it up and click on "Advanced", the rightmost icon at the top of the application. <a href="images/winebottler.png">Here's a screenshot of the settings</a> I use; I've renamed mineways32.exe to be Mineways.exe for this example. Click "Install", save to the "Documents" directory, and "Save As: Mineways". Wait a while, and then you can run (and redistribute) the Mineways.app produced. Note: do <I>not</I> save to the original Mineways directory where the mineways32.exe file is located, as this will cause a loop and the program will never finish. Note to self: download the original to the desktop. Output to Documents. Zip it up. Upload the zip, that's what gets distributed. Test by copying zip to Applications and double-clicking - should just run.

	<h2 id="Linux">Linux</h2>
        For Linux, download the Windows version and then use <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">WINE</a> to emulate Windows. Note: this also works on the Mac; the Mac version is merely the Windows version plus the WINE executables wrapped around it. That said, some Ubuntu Linux users have had problems (that I haven't figured out yet - something about GetMessage...) with version 5.00 and on. My advice: try <a href="http://realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/minewaysV417.zip">Version 4.17</a>.

<H2 id="troubleshooting">
General Troubleshooting
</H2>
If something goes wrong, here's the checklist I go through with people:
<UL>
<LI>Did you <a href="http://realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/mineways.zip">download the latest version</a>? Mineways has undergone many bug fixes.
<LI>Did you read any warnings from the program carefully?
<LI>Reboot and try the program one more time, just to be sure. Sometimes starting fresh clears out some box inadvertently checked, or untangles some hidden program bug.
<LI>Run through the platform-specific problems for <a href="#windows">Windows</a>, <a href="#mac">Mac</a>, and <a href="#Linux">Linux</a>.
</UL>
<P>
Here are some common problems:
<UL>
<LI> "I chose the map fine, but the screen is all gray" - first, try hitting F2 (jump to spawn) and F3 (jump to player) and see if that helps. Next, you <a href="http://realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/mineways.zip">have the latest version of Mineways</a>, right? Version 1.x of Mineways reads only older Minecraft (pre-1.2.x) worlds, not Anvil worlds. Version 2.x of Mineways reads Anvil worlds and will warn if it finds a pre-Anvil (unconverted) world.
<LI> "I don't like your torches/flames/etc." - you can remove any block from export by using a <a href="#schemes">color scheme</a>, then put your own models in place.
<LI> "I uploaded to Shapeways, but they say my model could not be processed" - read their email carefully. Often, however, they'll have no additional hints. First, you uploaded the .ZIP file, right? It should have a .wrl and .png file inside of it. Second thing to try: upload the .ZIP file again - I've sometimes had a model rejected which I then upload again and it's fine. Third thing: try exporting with the option "Weld all shared edges" checked. This may affect how your model looks, so preview it, but it does give a more robust (and stronger) model that Shapeways likes. <I>Do not</I> bother with trying STL instead of VRML; STL will not print at Shapeways with color.
<LI> "I uploaded to Shapeways, but on the model page it says the model is tiny" - on the Shapeways upload page where it says "Unit of Measure" and "Choose", the default is millimeters (though Shapeways has changed this in the past). Make sure you've got a version of Mineways newer than version 2.12 (look at "Help | About"), and "Model's units" on the export dialog should say "Millimeters".
<LI> "I selected a color scheme and the program locked up and died!" - my advice is to delete all your color schemes and remake them. Sorry about that! I thought I had licked this bug, but it's still there.
<LI> "It (still) doesn't work" - please <a href="mailto:erich@acm.org">email me</a>.
</UL>

<H3>Known Bugs</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Superhollow can sometimes create little separate objects at the bottom layer unconnected to the rest of the model, caused by internal tunnels. "Delete floating objects" currently does not remove these. The workaround is to use "fill in isolated tunnels", or to just let these separate little chunks print and pay a bit more for them. The real fix to add to the code is to search the whole model again for groups and delete the small groups.
</LI>
</UL>



<H2 id="myway">
How I Make an Export
</H2>

I'm assuming you have basic knowledge from the <a href="downloads.html#instructions">quick-start guide</a> or <a href="http://services.minecraftedu.com/wiki/3D_Printing_and_Minecraft#Instructions_for_Exporting">guide at MinecraftEdu</a> and can find options on the output dialog. If you need more information on a process, just follow the links or search this page for the term.
<P>
For me it starts with determining whether the model is printable at all: if it has elements that are floating in the air, then I either don't print it, or will add blocks to hold these elements up in the air when printed. If there are very thin columns holding up larger elements, I have to guess whether these thin columns will be able to support the weight or will break. Even <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mvives/6764530783/in/pool-1862849@N21/">trees will often break off</a>, because their trunks are too thin to stand up to the cleaning process.
<P>
If printable, I then decide what part of a model to print. If there's interesting construction below ground level, how deep do I want to go? Should the model get <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/postapocalyptic/6766819673/in/pool-1862849@N21/">printed as two or more pieces</a>, so I can see the rooms inside? If the model is symmetrical, should I print just half or a quarter of the model and show the interior that way?
<P>
Once I've figured out what to capture, there are then a few steps I walk through:
<UL>
<LI>First I do a rough selection of the volume of the model. I select an area, export, and <a href="mineways.html#previewing">view</a> by double-clicking on the WRL file produced. I then adjust the bounds by grabbing the border of the selection in Mineways with the right-mouse and dragging, and use the "[" and "]" keys to adjust the bottom's height, then use Control-X to instantly re-export. I export again, then in <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a> hit R to reload the model. Lather, rinse, repeat until I like the result I'm seeing in preview.
<LI>I'll check the price and see if it's affordable. If so, great. If it's too high, then I try out the ideas in <a href="#too_big">this section</a>. My mantra in all this is "smaller is cuter is cheaper". Complexity is free when doing 3D printing, cost is based entirely on the number and size of the blocks, not their positions. The downside of smaller block sizes is that you can't see the textures on them as well. The upside is that you get fine details that are more impressive; larger blocks look easier to make.
<LI>If I get the warning that there are floating pieces, I check them out in the preview (there's a special debug mode if they're not obvious) and usually just remove them by cranking up the "Delete floating objects" number, as shown in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJZMZEfEC0&t=2m15s">this tutorial</a>. This number is low by default, 16, as otherwise large pieces could be discarded without the user realizing it. 16 was chosen mostly so that floating bits of trees overlapping into the scene would be discarded. You can crank this number to 999999 and only the largest connected object will be saved.
<LI>Since cost is based on the model's weight (volume), my main thought is "how can I get rid of any blocks I'll never see?" The major part of the work is then making sure unseen rooms are sealed off, so that Mineways can do its job removing them. The easiest way to do this is to add torches to the entrances of rooms and then use the "Seal off entrances" option on the export dialog. What should then happen is that these sealed rooms get filled with glass, then the hollowing process will delete them. Note that you can play in and change your world while also running Mineways, just hit the "R" key in Mineways to reload your world with your changes.
<LI>Do I want to remove glass? If I want to look inside the building and it has glass in the windows, the glass should go (it doesn't print as transparent). Using a <a href="#schemes">color scheme</a> removes the glass, as described in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJZMZEfEC0&t=7m20s">this video tutorial</a> (note that if you use glass panes, you should remove those, too). The downside of removing glass is that costs usually go up, since rooms won't then get removed by hollowing.
<LI>Does filling in the tunnels look better? I'll try the option "Fill in isolated tunnels in base of model" and see how things look on the outside: do I mind having these tunnels filled in? I'll also check the cost and see how much money this option saves me (the price is always lower).
<LI>Should I use the <a href="#lesser">"Export lesser blocks" option</a>? If I have fine details I think would look cool and I don't think they'll break off in printing, then I turn it on.
<LI>Should I use another texture pack? I'm still experimenting in this area, and in practice the printing process won't pick up on many fine details (I'm guessing about 8x8 pixel resolution detail at 2 mm/block; at 3 mm/block the details show up well), but certainly the colors and contrast of a texture pack makes a difference. See <a href="#terrain_png">this section</a> about how to create and use terrainExt.png files.

<h1 id="msl">Mineways Scripting Language</h1>
		The "Import Settings" item in the File menu has two uses. One is that you can read in a model previously created with Mineways. Doing so will set up Mineways to be identical to how it was when the file was exported: the world, terrain file, color scheme, and all export settings will be set to what you used when you exported the model. This is handy for continuing to work on a model you exported in a previous session.
		<P>
		However, "Import Settings" can do much more. As of version 4.18 of Mineways, you can make a text file of Mineways scripting commands and read it in to:
		<UL>
		<LI>Set up a start-up configuration, similar to how model files can set the environment, plus setting initial location, zoom level, and other parameters.
		<LI>Automate a series of exports, so that you could create a whole series of files. This is handy if you want to export hunks of terrain for a level of detail system, for example.
		<LI>Access script-only commands that are too involved to expose in the menus. Some examples include:
			<UL>
			<LI> Turning your cobblestone castle into true stone, or even gold or diamond.
			<LI> Adding a base to a model you produced so it will stand up when 3D printed.
			<LI> Create sets of commands to make <a href="https://skfb.ly/OXVQ">whatever you want</a> out of different blocks.
			<LI> Or, simply trimming away particular cubes that you don't want to remove in your Minecraft world itself.
			</UL>
		</UL>
		None of these functions will affect your original Minecraft world. Mineways considers that data unmodifiable. The changes are performed temporarily on whatever you next export, and not displayed on the map.
		<P>
		Script files have the suffix ".mwscript". When using "Import Settings" note that you can use the file filter of the import dialog to display only these types of files.


<h2 id="mfi">Model File Import</h2>

		Model files have first lines such as:
		<P>
<div id="code">
# Wavefront OBJ file made by Mineways<br>
#VRML V2.0 utf8<br>
# Minecraft world: beta test world<br>
# Extracted from Minecraft world saves/BestWorld
</div>
		<P>
		Model export files have all their commands preceded by a "#", scripting language files do not. Script files are simple text files, and are usually stored with the suffix "*.mwscript". See the files that come with the Mineways distribution for examples. A file is considered to be a script if Mineways looks at it and doesn't think it's from a model.
		<P>
		One note on model import: for STL files the file you need to import is labeled *.txt. For example, if you export AwesomeCastle.stl, Mineways also creates an AwesomeCastle.txt file with statistics and settings about your export. OBJ and VRML files have these statistics contained at the top of their exported *.obj and *.wrl files.

		
<h1 id="so">Scripting Overview</h1>

		Most commands consist of a single line, and usually have a colon in them. There are two classes of commands: those that are recognized when an exported model is read in, and those recognized when a script is read. Most, but not all, of the exported model commands are recognized as script commands.
		<P>
		You can take many of the export commands found in model files and use them in a script you're creating. Transferring text from the top of a exported model to a script file is an easy way to get properly-formed commands in place. Simply remove the "#" from in front of each command to use it in a script file. See <a href="#default">this section</a> for what the default settings are when exporting for rendering.
		
		
<h2 id="mec">Model Export Commands</h2>

		Here is the full list of model export commands. When found in a model file, each line is preceded by a "#"; in scripting files the "#" is not used. Text in italics is shown as an example. "[deprecated]" means this format is output by older versions of Mineways. <B>WARNING</B>: I currently don't do much checking of what options you set. Some options don't work with some modes, e.g., you can turn on "Simplify mesh" when exporting individual blocks but it will do nothing. I try to guard against illegal combinations (though you won't be warned). Still, you may get a weird crash if you ask for something impossible.

If "all" is found, the values <i>-5000, 0, -5000</i> to <i>5000, 255, 5000</i> are used, which is usually enough to select any schematic imported - this is just a simple shorthand instead of writing it all out.

<h3 id="sqes">Example</h3>

Here is an example of a script using the commands above.
<P>
<div id="code">
Minecraft world: My Cool World<br>
Color scheme: no glass<br>
Terrain file name: C:\Users\erich\Desktop\Mineways\terrainExt_DokuLight.png<br>
Set render type: Wavefront OBJ absolute indices<br>
Use biomes: no<br>
Selection location min to max: -368, 83, 16 to -351, 255, 30<br>
</div>
<P>
This loads a world, changes its color scheme to "no glass", selects a terrain file, selects rendering to an OBJ file, turn biomes on, and finally selects a volume to export.	


<h2 id="sic">Scripting Interface Commands</h2>

The commands above are available for scripting, unless listed as <B>"Model only."</b> All script commands are used without a "#" in front of each line. Comments "//" and "/* */" are respected.
<P>
If you wish to set any export options, it's wise to first set the export mode and file type by using the "Set render type:" or "Set 3D print type:" command. If you don't, the export settings will be applied to whatever file type was last exported, if any, and a warning will pop up.
<P>
Because it's a powerful system that can itself create files, the script file is read twice. Syntax errors are checked for and flagged on the first read; no actions are done. If there are no syntax errors, then the script is read again and executed line by line. Script execution is aborted <I>for the whole script</I> if any execution error is found and caught. Pro tip: if you want to test a script for syntax errors and not execute it, put "FAIL" (or anything else that's not a command) as a line in the script. It will flag this line, and any other lines causing errors, and will not execute the script until all are fixed.
<P>
Even with error checking, it's definitely possible to set combinations that may crash Mineways, as there are complex interactions between systems and especially between blocks and some combinations are simply illegal. If things get wedged, just restart Mineways, which always resets its defaults to a known good state.

Set map view mode on or off, using TRUE/true/YES/yes/1 for on. Note that, as usual, showing the biomes doesn't set the checkbox to export them (well, export the biome in the center of the volume exported). The command "Use biomes: YES" does that.

Select minimum height: <i>V43</i><br>
Select minimum height: <i>v63</i><br>
</td>
<td>
Set the minimum height slider for the box volume to be exported. The +/- versions give a relative change, e.g., "-12" means subtract 12 from the current level, whatever it is. V/v is used to set the height level by looking at the selected area, plus a one-block border around it, and selecting the lowest height of the entire set of visible blocks. "V" means "ignore semitransparent blocks", those that can be seen through, such as water and glass. "v" means to pay attention to such blocks. Finally, V/v followed by a number means to use the level found, or the level specified, whichever is <i>larger</i>. For example, "V47" means find the minimum level of the selected area (plus one block border). If that level is greater than 47, use it; if less than 47, set the level to 47.
<P>
While involved to explain, settings such as "V43" can be useful for exporting the above-ground visible area - 43 is as deep as the oceans normally ever go. Deeper than this and the selected area probably has a deep hole that throws off the level. If you're exporting separate pieces of terrain for viewing, "V" is usually safe for showing everything above ground (you might miss an area with a large overhang, though, since the overhang will limit the minimum level found). If you <i>know</i> that you don't care about anything lower than, say, 57, then use "V57" to make sure the minimum level set is never lower than 57.

<tr>

Give more export memory: <i>YES</i>
</td>
<td>
On the 32-bit version (and on the Mac) you can run out of memory on export. This option frees up all the allocated map data and reloads it only as needed during export, giving Mineways more memory to use for its other processes. At the end of export the visible world is reloaded for display. This option can cause export to go more slowly.

</td>

<tr>
<td>
Close
</td>
<td>
This command has a dramatic effect: it closes the program! This can be useful if you want to run a script and exit when it's done.  Combined with a <a href="#clo">startup script</a>, you can make Mineways run a script and exit by just a double-click. You can also use the "-m" command-line option to have Mineways start up minimized, not showing its window. Note that if the script runs with any errors, error processing is done before the script closes, so that processing will stop and you'll be warned. If you don't want to ever halt on errors, use a log file; see the commands that follow.

For the world that is currently loaded, this sets the render type and file format, switches to the Nether level of the world loaded, selects an area, zooms the map, and performs a rendering export to the file nether.obj
<P>
Note that you could use this type of command sequence to export a bunch of adjacent areas, which you could then load into Blender or any other application as you wished. This can help you avoid hitting memory limits in Mineways, etc. As an example, here are the commands in <B>hunk_output.mwscript</B>, a script that comes with Mineways (along with <B>hunk_maker.py</B>, a Python program you can modify to generate sets of hunks as you wish; open and read the top of <B>hunk_maker.py</B> for how to edit and run it):

<P>
Load your world, run this script via Import Settings, and it will dump four exports, with absolute coordinates, so that they can be loaded into a modeler and nicely join with each other. The "50" lower Y height is just a guess as to how deep you might want to go for a typical above-ground export - you can override this as you wish. Biomes are off, since the biome is computed for the center of each hunk and so will differ. Block faces at the borders being off means that the polygons where the hunks join are not output, saving on polygon count. You can set that to "yes" if you prefer. You 
<P>
The one gotcha is that differently named (but usually identical in content) PNG texture files are made for each separate model. If you prefer sharing PNG files (which saves on memory), I solve this problem here by setting the File type to use individual textures for each block type face, such as "grass_top.png"; these have the same names for all exported files, all put in the same "hunks_textures" directory.

<h2 id="soc">Script-only Commands</h2>

These are the value-added commands, things you simply can't do otherwise in Mineways, such as set how your mouse is mapped (which you may want to do when you start the program, by <a href="#clo">calling a script on startup</a>), set parameters for the estimation of 3D print costs, or temporarily change blocks for the next export done.
<P>
Want to turn your stone castle into diamond? Or have all the leaves disappear from your trees? Or add a giant pyramid to your spawn point? The Change blocks command is the genie that can made your dreams come true, if only for a short while.
<P>
The idea behind Change blocks is that you can specify extremely temporary changes to your world. These will not show up on the map, and they affect only the next export you perform. After the export the changes are cleared out; you have to load these changes again if you want to apply them again. No actual changes are made to your Minecraft world files.
<P>
You can specify a series of commands, which are applied in the order given. Each command works on the results of whatever previous commands did. For example, if you turn all crops into potatoes, then turn potatoes into grass, this has the effect of turning all crops into grass.
<P>
<b>One warning:</b> just like a genie fulfilling your wishes, Change blocks commands can set up combinations that can inadvertently cause terrible things to happen, possibly causing assertions during export or even crashes. This is an expert-level feature, and it's up to you to do the right thing.

If <a href="mineways.html#biome_center">Use biome in center of export area</a> is selected on export, or script "Use biomes: YES", the biome type at the center of the exported area is used, affecting coloration. You can override which biome is used with this "Export using biome" command, setting a different number before exporting. IMPORTANT: you must also have set "Use biomes: YES".
<P>
You must select the number associated with the biome you want <a href="https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/blob/master/Win/biomes.cpp#L43">this piece of code</a>. For example, 6 is Swamp. Anything after the number is ignored (such as "Snowy Mountains" above), so you can use that area as a place to note what the number means. This number is -1 by default (which means it doesn't affect anything), and will get reset to -1 after a (successful or unsuccessful, biomes exported or not) model export.
<P>
When you export, the biome you used will be displayed in a comment near the top of the model file created. When you import this file, this "Export using biome" setting <i>will be ignored</i>. This command is meant as a temporary override, controlled entirely by scripting. When in doubt, set it before any export if you're using this feature (and don't forget to also set "Use biomes: YES").

Show informational: <i>true</i><br>
Show warning: <i>NO</i><br>
Show error: <i>script</i><br>
</td>
<td>
You can suppress informational, warning, and execution error pop-up dialog messages by setting the corresponding property to false. By default, all these are set to true. If you instead set the status to "script", this means the messages will be suppressed for the current script only and returned to "true" (normally visible) after the script is executed. Note that it's usually wise to set these all back to true at the end of any script that turns them off, as these settings are permanent for the session, so "script" is usually your best bet. Execution errors (not warnings) will abort a script, even if turned off with this command.
<P>
If turned off or set to "script", these messages will instead show up (usually briefly!) in the status line in the lower left of Mineways when exporting. They will also be sent to the script log file, if set - see the next command. A few warnings, such as when you manually turn on some experimental feature or for Sketchfab uploads, are always displayed and cannot be suppressed.

Save log file: <i>filename</i>
</td>
<td>
Instead of displaying script syntax errors, warnings, and informational messages to the screen in pop-up dialogs, write this information to the specified log file. Typically use this command at the beginning of a script. The log file is closed when the script is processed (that is, you'll have to issue this command again for any succeeding scripts). This is handy if you have syntax errors and want to look at them later.
<P>Normally only <I>syntax</I> errors in the script commands are saved to the log. Actual execution errors are still popped up. If you use "Show error: false" and similar commands for warnings, etc., these messages will be recorded in the log file instead. That said, a true execution error will still cause the script to abort, as usual. See the file <B>hunk_output.mwscript</B> for an example of how to use these commands.

Set mouse order: [left|middle|right] [left|middle|right] [left|middle|right]

Think of this command as setting the chosen mouse button for movement, bottom height selection, and rectangle selection, respectively, "Select mouse order: <i>movement button</I>, <i>height button</I>, <i>rectangle button</I>", and you specify a mouse button to each in turn.
By default:
<UL>
<LI>The left button moves (pans) the view
<LI>The middle button down selects the bottom height for export

Set unknown block ID: <i>322</i>

Set this value before opening a modded world. Modded worlds have block types not understood by Mineways. By default, unknown blocks are converted to bedrock blocks.

Note that after the unknown block is turned into that block type, it is treated exactly like that block type, including gettings its faces removed if the face is fully covered by a neighboring block.
<P>
By default the ID is set to 7, Bedrock. For Minecraft 1.12 and earlier this value must be 255 or lower. You might prefer setting it to, say, 103 - Melon. See "Translate" for a more powerful way to translate unknown blocks.

Added to help <a href="https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/issues/44">mod</a> and beta users a bit. For Minecraft 1.13 and newer. Pair some unknown block name to some standard name, e.g.: "Translate: nixie_tube beehive". Do not put quotes around the names, and any modding prefix in the file, e.g., "create:", should not be included - it is ignored. The list of block names that Mineways currently accepts is <b><a href="https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/blob/master/Win/nbt.cpp#L406">here</a></b>. If you want to attempt to use the block states of the modded block, put a "+" at the end of the block you're translating to. For example, "Translate: white_stained_glass_trapdoor bamboo_trapdoor+" tells Mineways to use the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Trapdoor#Block_states">block states of the trapdoor</a>. Unknown block states will of course be ignored. See the script <B>mod_translation.mwscript</B> for an example setup.

Any or all of these can be set; the defaults are shown when not modified. PLA is typically priced at $24 for a 1 kilogram (800 cubic centimeters) spool.

<h3 id="cbce">Change blocks command examples</h3>

The Change blocks command specifies a set of blocks to turn into a particular block ID and data value in a particular volume of space. It has seven variants, depending on whether you specify the from, to, and at values. Here are examples of each variant. A simple example is the <B>heightfield.py</B> Python program that comes with Mineways, which reads an image and creates a <B>heightfield.mwscript</B> file, example also included. See <a href="https://youtu.be/nqLYO4qofcM">this video</a> for the process.

<P>
Block names in the examples below are the standard English names seen in the game itself, not the internal "namespaced ID". <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_of_Diamond#Data_values">For example</a>, it's "block of diamond", not "diamond_block". See the names in <a href="https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/blob/master/Win/blockInfo.cpp#L70">this file</a>. Capitalization is unimportant.

<P>
<B>IMPORTANT NOTE:</B> This feature uses <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_data_value/Pre-flattening#Block_IDs">the old "pre-flattening" type/dataVal format</a> for specifying blocks, which went away in Minecraft 1.13. You can look up the type values <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_data_value/Pre-flattening#Block_IDs">here</a> - click the "[show]" link to the right of the "Block IDs" title. Wiser is to use the block names explicitly, as found in <a href="https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/blob/master/Win/blockInfo.cpp#L70">this file</a>. That said, I have shoved many newer 1.13+ blocks in various places, e.g., a warped_slab, blackstone_slab, and other new slabs have the same block ID, 361 (= 256+105), as crimson_slab, with a dataVal of 1, 2, etc. - see that encoded <a href="https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/blob/master/Win/nbt.cpp#L1170">here</a>. As an example, "crimson slab:2" means <a href="https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/blob/master/Win/nbt.cpp#L1171">a blackstone slab</a> (ignore "HIGH_BIT" in the code). I hope this helps.

<P>
Basically, if you're reading this and are extremely bitter that I don't clearly support some particular block you want and can't figure out how to set it, <a href="contact.html">write me</a> and plead your case. I could probably rework the nbt.cpp code to also use the namespaced ID names.

<h1 id="clo">Command Line Options</h1>

You can use command-line options with Mineways so that it is customized on startup. For example, you could provide a different initial window size, then have Mineways run a script that loads your favorite world and takes you to where you were last building.
<P>
You can <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/write-simple-batch-bat-file/">store this command line in a .bat file</a> and double-click that file, or <a href="https://windows.tips.net/T010869_Changing_Shortcut_Properties.html">change your options on the shortcut for Mineways itself</a>. See the file <b>mineways.bat</b> in Mineways for an example. It starts Mineways with a larger window, then calls the <B>scripting/startup.mwscript</B> script (which does nothing, but which you can edit to perform the various startup script commands shown above). Still confused? See <a href="downloads.html#generalTrouble">this page</a> and look for the item starting "I'd like to start up with" for a specific example.
<P>
Syntax:
<P>
<div id="code">
mineways.exe [-w X Y] [-m] [-s UserSaveDirectory|none] [-t terrainExtYourfile.png] [-l mineways_exec.log] [-suppress] [-zl #] [file1.mwscript|obj|wrl [file2.mwscript [...]]]
</div>
<P>
The command-line options are:
<P>
<i>file1.mwscript|obj|wrl</i><br>
Specify the file name and path for a script or previously exported model file to load on startup. So, you can use scripting, as above, or you can use the <a href="mineways.html#importsettings">"Import Settings" feature</a>: provide an .obj, .wrl, or .txt (from an .stl export) file from a previous export and it will load the world, take you to the model previously exported, and select it for further work.
<P>
-w <i>X Y</i><br>
Specify the X and Y resolution in pixels of the startup window. Values must be positive integers.
<P>
-m<br>
Start up Mineways as a minimized window. This setting is useful if you are running a command-line script that does a "Close" at the end, as all operations will run without (noticeably) popping up the Mineways window.
<P>
-s <i>UserSaveDirectory</i><br>
Specify the directory where all your Minecraft worlds are located, shown in the "File | Open World" list. This directory is "%appdata%\.minecraft\saves" by default, if not specified. The directory is not a single world's save folder, but rather a directory holding all world folders you want to choose from. If your directory path has spaces in it, you need to use double-quotes around the path, e.g., -s "C:\temp\My Minecraft Saves". Use "-s none" to load no world list at all.
<P>
-t <i>terrainExt*.png</i><br>
Specify the terrain file to use initially. See <a href="mineways.html#texture_output">the documentation</a> for more details on terrain files.
<P>
-l <i>mineways_exec.log</i><br>
For debugging startup problems; you'll normally never use this. This option saves a log of startup and commands executed. The file mineways_debug_log.bat runs Mineways in this way.
<P>
-suppress<br>
Suppress all informational, warning, and error popups. Equivalent to "Show informational: false", "Show warning: false", and "Show error: false", but performed before any other operations are done in Mineways. This allows a nearly-batch mode for Mineways with no pauses, as no popups will appear at startup (such as "bad world" warnings) or during execution of any scripts executed. You can turn popup display back on during execution normally, e.g., a script with "Show error: true", "Show warning: YES", etc.
<P>
-zl <i>MinZoom</i><br>
Congratulations! You found an experimental feature, equivalent to <a href="reference.html#vm">Zoom out further</a>. <I>Setting this may cause memory problems or crashes on your machine.</I> Normally Mineways has a limit to how far you can zoom out: 1 pixel per block. But, if you set this MinZoom value to something lower than 1.0, that's how low you can zoom out with the mouse wheel. For example, 0.5 means 0.5 pixels per block, aka 1 pixel for every 2 blocks in width on the screen. Lowest you can go is 0.0625 (16 blocks wide per pixel). This zoom level lets you see a lot more of your world in the window. It'll also load a lot more blocks (a LOT more. For example, 0.5 means loading four - 2x2 - more blocks to display. 0.0625 means loading 256 more blocks per pixel than normal). You may experience slowdowns or a crash as you zoom farther out, as more and more chunks get loaded. Have fun! <B>Bonus behavior:</B> if you set this zoom value on startup, you'll have more cache available as you pan around your map. So, for example, you could set "-zl 0.25" and more chunks will be cached overall, leading to less hesitation when you scroll around further. Give it a try if you find you scroll back and forth between areas a lot (or just use View -> Focus View on the menu).
<P>
Here are a few examples:
<P>
<div id="code">
mineways.exe -w 800 900
</div>
<P>
Start up Mineways in an 800 x 900 size window. Note that a larger window does mean a slower world load time, since more chunks are visible on load.
<P>
<div id="code">
mineways.exe MyCastle.obj
</div>
<P>
Import the settings for the previously-exported model MyCastle.obj, its rendering mode, selection volume, and all other export settings. Essentially runs the <a href="mineways.html#importsettings">Import Settings function</a> in the File menu.
<P>
<div id="code">
mineways.exe scripting/startup.mwscript
</div>
<P>
Run the script <B>startup.mwscript</B> in the scripting directory at startup. Useful for setting default export options or other things you prefer.

If you exported a model just how you like it, you can import it and modify its settings with whatever commands are in your <B>modify.mwscript</B>. When using multiple scripts, it's wise to give the full path to each file, as Mineways will modify the default directory used to load files. Note that double quotes are needed when the file or path contains a space character, such as shown in this example for "My House.obj".
<P>
<div id="code">
mineways.exe -m "C:\Mineways\Load Eiffel.mwscript" C:\Mineways\export.mwscript C:\Mineways\close.mwscript
</div>
<P>
Start minimized and run the specified scripts at startup. The "Load Eiffel" script might load a world and select the Eiffel model in that world. The export script exports it, and the close script closes Mineways. This allows you to essentially run Mineways from the command line with no interactions needed. Running minimized also speeds up processing, since only the map chunks in the exported model are loaded.
<div id="code">
mineways.exe -s C:\MyWorlds
</div>
<P>
Load the world folders contained in C:\MyWorlds so that they appear in the "File | Open World" menu list. If you want to not load any list of worlds, use:
<div id="code">
mineways.exe -s none
</div>
<P>
Do not load any list of worlds on startup.
This can be useful if Mineways does not start properly, to rule out world files causing the problem, or if you're running a script on startup and do not need the world list loaded.

<H1 id="amfwm">Associating .mwscript files with Mineways</H1>

On Windows, run the batch file <b>register-Mineways-run-as-administrator.bat</b> as administrator. Go to the folder where the Mineways code is and right-click on <b>register-Mineways-run-as-administrator.bat</b> and then select "Run as administrator" from the list:
<P>
  <div>
    <img src="images/administrator.jpg" alt="administrator">
  </div>
<P>
You should see any *.mwscript files with Mineways icons next to them:
  <div>
    <img src="images/script_files.jpg" alt="script files">
  </div>
<P>
Now when you double-click on a file ending with .mwscript, it will run this script on startup.

<h1 id="default">Default Rendering Options</h1>

What follows are the default rendering options when Export for Rendering is performed. This list was created by exporting a sample rendering from a world, editing the OBJ file, grabbing the header and removing the "#" character at the beginning of each line, and commenting out the lines that are purely comments by using "//". This is provided here as a guide to all the export options available.

<h1 id="pse">Perl Script Example</h1>

Here's a simple Perl script to generate a Mineways script. It shows the power of scripting to make models. Another example is the <B>heightfield.py</B> file that comes with Mineways, which reads an image and creates a heightfield. See <a href="https://youtu.be/nqLYO4qofcM">this video</a> for the process.
